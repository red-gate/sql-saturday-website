                        Numbers for new events are assigned on a first come basis once the event is added to the system. Once an administrator adds a pull request for your event,
                        the number is assigned and used for your event. Future events will get subsequent numbers. 
                    </p>
                    <p align="left" style="margin-left: 10em;">
                        You can, however, name your event anything after the SQL Saturday #xxx part. For example
                        if you want an edition, you can so something like

You can customize this, and there is no cost if you are running a free event. This service allows you to build a schedule and produce a script that can be used on this website to display your schedule.

                        <b>Email</b> - You can have speakers submit sessions through email, but this might not be a good solution if you get more than 20-30 submissions.

                    <p align="left">
                        There are a number of ways to register people for events, though this might not be that important for virtual events. However, you do want a way to contact people, so at a minimum, you want a mailing list of attendees. Below are a few options:
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">

                        <b><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/organizer/overview/">EventBrite</a></b> - They offer free events, which do not cost you money to run. You can have people register for the event here and send our URLs.

                        While the costs for a virtual event might be small, there may be some expenses. Raising money for events is a skill, and will be a necessity for most live, physical events.
                        The old SQL Saturday plans are gone, but <a href="https://datadriventechnologies.org/2021/02/22/2021-data-sql-saturday-sponsorship-plan/">a sample sponsorship plan</a> from the Data.SQLSaturday.LA event is available.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        You might consider using <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/organizer/overview/">EventBrite</a> to create an event for sponsors, with paid plans. This is an easy way to get started.</p>
                        <p align="left">
                            In order to receive money from many vendors, you need to have a bank account set up. While some may send to personal accounts or send a physical check, many want to get an invoice, so be prepared to produce one. Excel contains a number of templates for you.

                            <li>Number of tracks - Less is easier for virtual, especially with lots of events.</li>
                            <li>Multiple speakers on one track with a single URL or different ones for each session (simpler is easier).</li>
                            <li>Moderators - If you have moderators to hold open meetings, as with Zoom, you can just have speakers join. Some platforms, like Streamyard, give you control over who appears when.</li>
                            <li>Recording - You may not want to keep recordings, but if you do, plan for the storage and a release from speakers.</li>

                    <p align="left">
                        The best marketing you will have for your event will be word of mouth, so the more people you can reach and get excited about your event, the better.
                        Use your local user group mailing lists and meetings to announce your event, and contact other groups in your area that may be interested.
